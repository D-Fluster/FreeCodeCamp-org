<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- STEP 1 - SPECIFYING THE LANGUAGE: 
  * Welcome to the first part of the Accessibility Quiz
  * We start this accessibility journey by providing a "lang" attribute to our "html" element to assist screen readers in identifying the language of the page -->

<html lang="en">
  <head>

    <!-- STEPS 2 thru 4 - META TAGS: 
      * You may be familiar with the <meta> element already; it is used to specify information about the page, such as the title, description, keywords, and author
      * Here, we give our page a <meta> element with an appropriate "charset" value
      * The "charset" attribute specifies the character encoding of the page, and, nowadays, "UTF-8" is the only encoding supported by most browsers

      * Continuing with the <meta> elements, a "viewport" definition tells the browser how to render the page; including one betters visual accessibility on mobile, and improves SEO (search engine optimization)
      * Next, we add a "viewport" definition with a "content" attribute detailing the "width" and "initial-scale" of the page

      * Another important <meta> element for accessibility and SEO is the "description" definition; the value of the "content" attribute is used by search engines to provide a description of your page
      * Finally, we add a <meta> element with the "name" attribute set to "description", and give it a useful "content" attribute -->

    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <meta name="description" content="freeCodeCamp Accessibility Quiz practice project" />
    
    <!-- STEP 5 - THE TITLE:
      * Lastly in the <head>, the <title> element is useful for screen readers to understand the content of a page
      * Furthermore, it is an important part of SEO
      * Here, we give our page a <title> that is descriptive and concise -->

    <title>Accessibility Quiz</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
  </head>
  <body>

    <!-- STEP 6 - STRUCTURE & NAGIVATION:
      * Navigation is a core part of accessibility, and screen readers rely on you to provide the structure of your page
      * This is accomplished with semantic HTML elements
      * Thus, we add a <header> and a <main> element to our page here
      * The <header> element will be used to introduce the page, as well as provide a navigation menu
      * The <main> element will contain the core content of your page -->
    
    <!-- STEP 7 - THE HEADER: 
      * Within the header, provide context about the page by nesting one <img>, <h1>, and <nav> element -->

    <header>
      <img id="logo" src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/platform/universal/fcc_primary.svg">
      <h1>HTML/CSS Quiz</h1>

      <!-- STEPS 12 & 18 - THE NAVIGATION BAR:
        * To enable navigation on the page, we add an unordered list with three list items, whose text is wrapped in anchor tags 
      
        * Then, to be able to navigate within the page, we give each anchor element an "href" corresponding to the "id" of the matching <h2> elements -->

      <!-- STEP 68 - ADDING KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS: 
        * Finally, the navigation accessibility can be improved by providing keyboard shortcuts
        * The "accesskey" attribute accepts a space-separated list of access keys -- for example:
           **  <button type="submit" accesskey="s">Submit</button>
        * Here, we give each of the navigation links a single-letter access key
        * Note: It is not always advised to use access keys, but they can be useful -->

      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#student-info" accesskey="i">INFO</a></li>
          <li><a href="#html-questions" accesskey="h">HTML</a></li>
          <li><a href="#css-questions" accesskey="c">CSS</a></li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
    </header>
    <main>

      <!-- STEP 14 - FORM SECTIONS:
          * As this is a quiz, you will need a form for users to submit answers
          * You can semantically separate the content within the form using <section> elements
          * Within the <main> element, we create a <form> with three nested <section> elements
          * Then, we make the form submit to "https://freecodecamp.org/practice-project/accessibility-quiz" using the correct method -->

      <form method="post" action="https://freecodecamp.org/practice-project/accessibility-quiz">

        <!-- STEPS 15 & 16 - ROLES & REGIONS:
          * To increase the page accessibility, the "role" attribute can be used to indicate the purpose behind an element on the page to assistive technologies
          * The "role" attribute is a part of the "Web Accessibility Initiative" (WAI), and accepts preset values
          * Here, we give each of the <section> elements the "role" of "region" 
            
          * Every "region" role requires a label, which helps screen reader users understand the purpose of the region
          * One method for adding a label is to add a heading element inside the region and then reference it with the "aria-labelledby" attribute
          * Here, we first add "aria-labelledby" attributes to each of the <section> elements
          * Then, within each <section> element, we nest one <h2> element with an "id" matching the corresponding "aria-labelledby" attribute and some suitable text content -->

        <section role="region" aria-labelledby="student-info">
          <h2 id="student-info">Student Info</h2>

          <!-- STEPS 19 thru 21 - INPUTS & LABELS:
            * Filling out the content of the quiz, we first add three <div> elements with a "class" of "info" below "#student-info"
            * Then, within each <div>, we nest one <label> element and one <input> element

            * It is important to link each <input> to the corresponding <label> element; this provides assistive technology users with a visual reference to the input
            * This is done by giving the <label> a "for" attribute, which contains the "id" of the <input> 
            
            * Then, keeping in mind best-practices for form inputs, we give each <input> an appropriate "type" and "name" attribute -->
          
          <!-- STEPS 21 & 22 - PLACEHOLDER TEXT:
            * Initially, we give the first <input> a "placeholder" attribute

            * However, this is actually not a best-practice for accessibility; too often, users confuse the placeholder text with an actual input value and they think there is already a value in the input
            * Thus, we remove the placeholder text from the first <input> element, relying on the <label> being the best-practice -->

          <div class="info">
            <label for="student-name">Name:</label>
            <input type="text" name="student-name" id="student-name" />
          </div>
          <div class="info">
            <label for="student-email">Email:</label>
            <input type="email" name="student-email" id="student-email" />
          </div>
          <div class="info">

            <!-- STEPS 23 & 24 - ADDING CONTEXT FOR SCREEN READERS ONLY:
              * Arguably, "D.O.B." is not descriptive enough, which is especially true for visually impaired users
              * One way to get around such an issue, without having to add visible text to the label, is to add text only a screen reader can read
              * Here, we append a <span> element with a "class" of "sr-only" to the text content of this third label element
                
              * Within the <span> element, we add the text "(Date of Birth)"
              * Finally, we'll use CSS to hide that text, except from screen readers -->

            <label for="birth-date">D.O.B.<span class="sr-only">(Date of Birth)</span></label>
            <input type="date" name="birth-date" id="birth-date" />
          </div>
        </section>
        <section role="region" aria-labelledby="html-questions">
          <h2 id="html-questions">HTML</h2>
          <div class="question-block">
            <p>1</p>

            <!-- STEPS 27 thru 33 - TRUE/FALSE QUESTIONS: 
              * Each <fieldset> will contain a true/false question
              * First, within each <fieldset>, we nest one <legend> element, and one <ul> element with two options

              * Next, we give each <fieldset> an adequate "name" attribute and give both unordered lists a "class" of "answers-list"
              * Finally, we use the <legend> to caption the content of the <fieldset> by placing a true/false question as the text content

              * To provide the functionality of the true/false questions, we need a set of inputs which do not allow both to be selected at the same time (i.e., radios)
              * Thus, within each list element, we nest one <label> element, and within each <label> element we nest one <input> element with the appropriate type

              * Then, we add an "id" to all of the radio <input>s so we can link our labels to them

              * Although not required for <label> elements with a nested <input>, it is still best-practice to explicitly link a <label> with its corresponding <input> element
              * Thus, we add a "for" attribute to each of our four <label>s that links the <label> to its corresponding radio <input>

              * Next, we give the <label> elements text (i..e, "True" or "False") such that the input comes before the text
              * Then, we give the <input> elements a "value" matching the text

              * Initially, if you click on the radio inputs, you might notice both inputs within the same true/false fieldset can be selected at the same time
              * Thus, we group the relevant <input>s together such that only one <input> from a pair can be selected at a time -->

            <fieldset class="question" name="html-question-one">
              <legend>
                The legend element represents a caption for the content of its parent fieldset element
              </legend>
              <ul class="answers-list">
                <li>
                  <label for="q1-a1">
                    <input type="radio" id="q1-a1" name="q1" value="true" />
                    True
                  </label>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <label for="q1-a2">
                    <input type="radio" id="q1-a2" name="q1" value="false" />
                    False
                  </label>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </fieldset>
          </div>
          <div class="question-block">
            <p>2</p>
            <fieldset class="question" name="html-question-two">
              <legend>
                A label element nesting an input element is required to have a for attribute with the same value as the input's id
              </legend>
              <ul class="answers-list">
                <li>
                  <label for="q2-a1">
                    <input type="radio" id="q2-a1" name="q2" value="true" />
                    True
                  </label>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <label for="q2-a2">
                    <input type="radio" id="q2-a2" name="q2" value="false" />
                    False
                  </label>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </fieldset>
          </div>
        </section>
        <section role="region" aria-labelledby="css-questions">
          <h2 id="css-questions">CSS</h2>

          <!-- STEPS 35 thru 38 - DROP-DOWN QUESTION:
            * The final section of this quiz will contain a dropdown, and a text box
            * We begin by nesting a <div> with a "class" of "formrow" with four <div> elements inside of it, alternating their "class" attributes between "question-block" and "answer"

            * Then, within the "div.question-block" elements, we nest one <label> element, and add a CSS-related question to the <label> text
            
            * Next, within the first "div.answer" element, we nest one "required" <select> element with three <option> elements
            * We give the first <option> element a "value" of "" and the text "Select an option", the second <option> element a "value" of "yes" and the text "Yes", and the third <option> element a "value" of "no" and the text "No"

            * Then, we link the first <label> element to the <select> element, and give the <select> element a "name" attribute -->

          <div class="formrow">
            <div class="question-block">
              <label for="selector">Can the CSS margin property accept negative values?</label>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
              <select name="selector" id="selector" required>
                <option value="">Select an option</option>
                <option value="yes">Yes</option>
                <option value="no">No</option>
              </select>
            </div>
            <div class="question-block">
              <label for="css-textarea">Do you have any questions:</label>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">

              <!-- STEPS 39 & 40 - FREE RESPONSE QUESTION: 
                * We nest one <textarea> element within the second "div.answer" element, and set the number of rows and columns it has
                * Then, we give the <textarea> placeholder text describing an example answer 
                  
                * Next, as with the other <input> and <label> elements, we link the <textarea> to its corresponding <label> element, and give it a "name" attribute -->

              <textarea id="css-textarea" name="css-questions" rows="5" cols="24" placeholder="Who is flexbox..."></textarea>
            </div>
          </div>
        </section>

        <!-- STEP 41 - THE SUBMIT BUTTON:
          * Do not forget to give your <form> a submit button with the text "Send" -->

        <button type="submit">Send</button>
      </form>
    </main>

    <!-- STEPS 42 thru 44 - THE FOOTER:
      * Two final semantic HTML elements for this project are the <footer> and <address> elements
      * The <footer> element is a container for a collection of content that is related to the page
      * The <address> element is a container for contact information for the author of the page
      * Thus, after the <main> element we add one <footer> element and nest one <address> element within it
    
      * We use <br> tags to allow each part of the address to be on its own line, as they are useful for presenting <address> elements properly

      * The <address> element does not have to contain a physical geographical location; it can also be used to provide a link to the subject -->

    <footer>
      <address>
        <a href="https://freecodecamp.org">freeCodeCamp</a><br />
