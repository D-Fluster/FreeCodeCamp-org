    // See: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-html-by-building-a-cat-photo-app/

    // DESCRIPTION:
    HTML tags give a webpage its structure. You can use HTML tags to add photos, buttons, and other elements to your webpage.

    In this course, you'll learn the most common HTML tags by building your own cat photo app.

<!-- STEP 4 - COMMENTS:
  * Commenting allows you to leave messages without affecting the browser display
  * It also allows you to make code inactive
  * A comment in HTML starts can contain any number of lines of text -->

<!-- STEP 68 - DOCTYPE:
  * All pages should begin with <!DOCTYPE html>
  * This special string is known as a "declaration" and ensures the browser tries to meet industry-wide specifications -->
  
<!DOCTYPE html>

  <!-- STEPS 6 & 67 - HTML & NESTING ELEMENTS:
    * Nested elements should be placed two spaces further to the right of the element they are nested in
    * This spacing is called indentation and it is used to make HTML easier to read
    * Notice that the entire contents of the page are nested within an <html> element; all other elements must be descendants of this <html> element
    * Adding the "lang" attribute with the value "en" to the opening <html> tag specifies that the language of the page is English -->

  <html lang="en">
      
  <!-- STEP 65 - HEAD & BODY:
    * All page content elements that should be rendered to the page go inside the <body> element
    * However, other important information goes inside the <head> element -->
    
  <head>

    <!-- STEP 69 - META TAGS:
      * You can set browser behavior by adding self-closing <meta> elements in the head
      * For example, to tell the browser how to encode characters for the page, you can nest a <meta> element with an attribute named "charset" with the value "utf-8" -->
    
    <meta charset="utf-8">

    <!-- STEP 66 -  TITLES: 
      * The <title> element determines what browsers show in the title bar or tab for the page -->

    <title>CatPhotoApp</title>
  </head>

  <body>

    <!-- STEP 5 - SEO & ACCESSIBILITY IN HTML 5:
      * HTML5 has some elements that identify different content areas
      * These elements make your HTML easier to read and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility
      * We identify the main section of this page by using a <main> tag -->

    <main>

      <!-- STEP 2 - HEADINGS: 
        * The h1 through h6 heading elements are used to signify the importance of content below them
        * The lower the number, the higher the importance, so h2 elements have less importance than h1 elements
        * Only use one h1 element per page and place lower importance headings below higher importance headings -->

      <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>

      <!-- STEPS 16 thru 19 - SECTIONS:
        * Before adding any new content, you should make use of a section element to separate the cat photos content from the future content
        * When you add a lower rank heading element to the page, it's implied that you're starting a new subsection -->
      
      <section>
        <h2>Cat Photos</h2>

        <!-- STEP 3 - PARAGRAPHS:
          * The p element is used to create a paragraph of text on websites.-->

        <p>See more <a target="_blank" href="https://freecatphotoapp.com">cat photos</a> in our gallery.</p>

        <!-- STEPS 7 thru 9 & 46 - IMAGES & ATTRIBUTES:
          * <img> elements have an opening tag without a closing tag
          * A tag for an element without a closing tag is known as a self-closing tag
          * HTML "attributes" are special words used inside the opening tag of an element to control the element's behavior
          * For example, the "src" attribute in an <img> element specifies the image's URL (where the image is located)
          * All <img> elements should have an "alt" attribute
          * The "alt" attribute's text is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load 
          * When elements have multiple attributes, the order of the attributes doesn't matter -->

        <!-- STEPS 10 thru 15 - ANCHORS/LINKS:    
          * You can link to another page with the anchor (<a>) element and a "href" attribute
          * Adding a "target" attribute with the value "_blank" to an <a> element's opening tag opens the link in a new tab -->

        <h2>Cat Lists</h2>
        <h3>Things cats love:</h3>

        <!-- STEP 20, 21 & 27 - LISTS:
          * Unordered list (<ul>) element
          * An ordered list (<ol>) is similar to an unordered list, but list items in an ordered list are numbered when displayed
          * Use list item (<li>) elements to create items in a list -->

        <ul>
          <li>cat nip</li>
          <li>laser pointers</li>
          <li>lasagna</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- STEP 23 - FIGURES:
          * The <figure> element represents self-contained content and will allow you to associate an image with a caption
          * Nest images within <figure> elements -->

        <figure>
          <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/lasagna.jpg" alt="A slice of lasagna on a plate.">

          <!-- STEP 24 - FIGURE CAPTIONS:
            * A figure caption (<figcaption>) element is used to add a caption to describe the image contained within the figure element
            * After the image nested in the figure element, add a figcaption element -->
          
          <!-- STEP 25 - EMPHASIS:
            * Emphasize text by wrapping it in an emphasis (<em>) element -->

          <figcaption>Cats <em>love</em> lasagna.</figcaption>  
        </figure>

        <h3>Top 3 things cats hate:</h3>

        <ol>
          <li>flea treatment</li>
          <li>thunder</li>
          <li>other cats</li>
        </ol>

        <figure>
          <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/cats.jpg" alt="Five cats looking around a field.">

          <!-- STEP 32 - STRONG: 
            * The <strong> element is used to indicate that some text is of strong importance or urgent -->

          <figcaption>Cats <strong>hate</strong> other cats.</figcaption>  
        </figure>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Cat Form</h2>

        <!-- STEPS 35 & 36 - FORMS:
          * A web form can collect information from users using the <form> element 
          * The "action" attribute indicates where form data should be sent
          * For example, the following tells the browser that the form data should be sent to the path "/submit-url":
            ** <form action="/submit-url"></form> -->

        <form action="https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">

          <!-- STEP 50 - FIELDSETS:
            * The <fieldset> element is used to group related inputs and labels together in a web form
            * <fieldset> elements are block-level elements, meaning that they appear on a new line -->
          
          <fieldset>

            <!-- STEP 51 - LEGENDS: 
              * The <legend> element acts as a caption for the content in the <fieldset> element
              * It gives users context about what they should enter into that part of the form -->

            <legend>Is your cat an indoor or outdoor cat?</legend>

            <!-- STEPS 37 thru 39 - INPUTS: 
              * The <input> element allows you several ways to collect data from a web form
              * Like <img> elements, <input> elements are self-closing and do not need closing tags
              * There are many kinds of inputs you can create using the "type" attribute
              * You can easily create a password field, reset button, or a control to let users select a file from their computer 
              * In order for a form's data to be accessed by the location specified in the "action" attribute, you must give the text field a "name" attribute and assign it a value to represent the data being submitted
              * For example, you could use the following syntax for an email address text field:
                ** <input type="text" name="email"> -->

            <!-- STEPS 44, 48 & 49 - RADIO BUTTONS:
              * You can use radio buttons for questions where you want only one answer out of multiple options
              * By default, multiple radio buttons can be selected at the same time
              * To make it so selecting one radio button automatically deselects the other, both buttons must have a "name" attribute with the same value
              * If you select a radio button and submit the form, the form data for the button is based on its "name" and "value" attributes
              * If your radio buttons do not have a "value" attribute, the form data will include "name=on" (e.g., "indoor-outdoor=on"), which is not useful when you have multiple buttons
              * For convenience, set the button's "value" attribute to the same value as its "id" attribute -->
            
            <!-- STEP 45 - LABELS:
              * <label> elements are used to help associate the text for an <input> element with the <input> element itself, especially for assistive technologies like screen readers
              * For example, the following makes it so clicking the word "cat" also selects the corresponding radio button:
                ** <label><input type="radio"> cat</label> -->
            
            <!-- STEP 46 - IDs: 
              * The "id" attribute is used to identify specific HTML elements
              * Each "id" attribute's value must be unique from all other "id" values for the entire page -->

            <label><input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="indoor" checked> Indoor</label>
            <label><input id="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="outdoor"> Outdoor</label>
          </fieldset>

          <fieldset>
            <legend>What's your cat's personality?</legend>

            <!-- STEPS 54, 57 & 60 - CHECKBOXES:
              * Forms commonly use checkboxes for questions that may have more than one answer
              * For example, here's a checkbox with the option of tacos:
                ** <input type="checkbox"> tacos 
              * Add a "name" attribute with the same value to each of the checkbox <input> elements; while you won't notice this in the browser, doing this makes it easier for a server to process your web form, especially when there are multiple checkboxes 
              * Like radio buttons, form data for selected checkboxes are "name"/"value" attribute pairs
              * While the "value" attribute is optional, it's best practice to include it with any checkboxes or radio buttons on the page -->

            <!-- STEP 56 - LABELS "FOR":
              * There's another way to associate an <input> element's text with the element itself: you can nest the text within a <label> element and add a "for" attribute with the same value as the <input> element's "id" attribute -->

            <!-- STEP 61 - DEFAULT CHECKS: 
              * In order to make a checkbox checked or radio button selected by default, you need to add the "checked" attribute to it
              * There's no need to set a value to the "checked" attribute; instead, just add the word "checked" to the <input> element, making sure there is space between it and other attributes -->

            <input id="loving" type="checkbox" name="personality" value="loving" checked> <label for="loving">Loving</label>
            <input id="lazy" type="checkbox" name="personality" value="lazy"> <label for="lazy">Lazy</label>
            <input id="energetic" type="checkbox" name="personality" value="energetic"> <label for="energetic">Energetic</label>
          </fieldset>

          <!-- STEPS 38 thru 40 - TEXT INPUTS: 
            * You can create a text field to get text input from a user by adding the "type" attribute with the value "text" to an <input> element
            * Placeholder text is used to give people a hint about what kind of information to enter into an input; for example:
              ** <input type="text" placeholder="Email address"> -->

          <!-- STEP 41 - REQUIRED INPUTS: 
            * To prevent a user from submitting your form when required information is missing, you need to add the "required" attribute to an input element
            * There's no need to set a value to the required attribute; instead, just add the word "required" to the input element, making sure there is space between it and other attributes -->

          <input type="text" name="catphotourl" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>

          <!-- STEPS 42 & 43 - BUTTONS:
            * Use the <button> element to create a clickable button
            * The default behavior of clicking a form button without any attributes submits the form to the location specified in the form's "action" attribute
            * While the button will submit the form by default, relying on default behavior may cause confusion
            * You can add the "type" attribute with the value "submit" to the button to make it clear that it is a submit button -->

          <!-- STEP 43 - A NOTE ON FORMATTING:
            * Even though you added your button below the text input, they appear next to each other on the page
            * That's because both input and button elements are inline elements, which don't appear on new lines. -->

          <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
      </section>
    </main>

    <!-- STEP 62 - FOOTERS:
      * You can add a footer section to the page with the <footer> element -->
