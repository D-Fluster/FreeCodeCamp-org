  <body>
    <h1>Registration Form</h1>
    <p>Please fill out this form with the required information</p>

    <!-- STEPS 11 & 12 - INITIALIZING THE FORM:
      * To create a form, first insert a <form> with an "action" attribute
      * The "method" attribute specifies how to send form-data to the URL specified in the "action" attribute
      * The form-data can be sent via a "GET" request as URL parameters (with method="get") or via a "POST" request as data in the request body (with method="post") -->

    <form method="post" action='https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org'>
      <fieldset>

        <!-- STEPS 18 & 42 - ACCESSIBILITY:
          * Following accessibility best practices, we link the <input> elements and the <label> elements together using the "for" attribute 
            
          * With form submissions, it is useful, and good practice, to provide each submittable element with a "name" attribute, which is used to identify the element in the form submission -->

        <!-- STEP 19 - INPUT TYPES:
          * Specifying the "type" attribute of a form element is important for the browser to know what kind of data it should expect
          * If a type is not specified, the browser will default to "text"
          * The "email" type only allows emails with a "@" and a "." in the domain
          * The "password" type obscures the input and warns if the site does not use HTTPS -->

        <!-- STEP 21 - REQUIRED INPUTS:
          * To make the form more interactive, we add the "required" attribute to the <input> elements in the <fieldset>
          * Now, if you try to submit the form without filling in the required fields, you will see an error message -->

        <label for="first-name">Enter Your First Name: <input id="first-name" name="first-name" type="text" required /></label>
        <label for="last-name">Enter Your Last Name: <input id="last-name" name="last-name" type="text" required /></label>

        <!-- STEP 22 - BUILT-IN FORM VALIDATION:
          * Certain "type" attribute values come with built-in form validation -- e.g., type="email" requires that the value be a valid email address
          * We can also add custom validation -- e.g., adding a "minlength" attribute with a value of "8" to the "password" <input> element prevents inputs of less than 8 characters being submitted -->

        <label for="email">Enter Your Email: <input id="email" name="email" type="email" required /></label>

        <!-- STEP 23 - USING REGEX FOR VALIDATION: 
          * With type="password" you can use the "pattern" attribute to define a regular expression that the password must match to be considered valid
          // For example, "[a-z0-5]{8,}" is a regular expression which matches eight or more lowercase letters or the digits 0 to 5 -->

        <label for="new-password">Create a New Password: <input id="new-password" name="new-password" type="password" pattern="[a-z0-5]{8,}" required /></label>
      </fieldset>

      <fieldset>
        <legend>Account type (required)</legend>

        <!-- STEP 27 - RADIO BUTTON REMINDER:
          * You only want one radio input to be selectable at a time
          * However, the form does not know the radio inputs are related
          * To relate the radio inputs, give them both/all a "name" attribute with the same value 
          * Now, it is not possible to select multiple radio inputs at the same time
        -->

        <!-- STEP 28 - REQUIRING RADIO INPUTS:
          * Initially, users can submit the form without checking the radio inputs
          * Although you previously used the "required" attribute to indicate that an input is required, it won't work in this case because adding required to both inputs will convey the wrong information to users
          * Instead, you can provide context of what is needed by adding a legend element with text "Item (required)" before the <label> elements, then add the "checked" attribute to one input to ensure the form is submitted with the required data in it -->

        <label for="personal-account"><input id="personal-account" type="radio" name="account-type" class="inline" checked /> Personal</label>
        <label for="business-account"><input id="business-account" type="radio" name="account-type" class="inline" /> Business</label>
      </fieldset>

      <fieldset>

        <!-- STEP 32 - FILE INPUT: 
          * The <input> type "file" allows users to upload an image or other file type -->

        <label for="profile-picture">Upload a profile picture: <input id="profile-picture" type="file" name="file" /></label>

        <!-- STEP 33 - NUMBER INPUT: 
          * To collect and verify ages, we can use an <input> with the type of "number" and a "min" and "max" attribute
          * Now, if someone tries to submit the form with values outside of the range (e.g., "13" to "120"), a warning will appear and the form will not submit -->
        
        <label for="age">Input your age (years): <input id="age" type="number" name="age" min="13" max="120" /></label>

        <!-- STEPS 34 thru 37 - DROPDOWN: 
          * Adding a dropdown to the <form> is easy with the <select> element
          * The <select> element is a container for a group of <option> elements, and each <option> element acts as a label for the dropdown options
          * Both the <select> and <option> elements require closing tags

          * The <label> element should wrap the entire <select> element with the label's text coming before the opening <select> 
            
          * Initially, submitting the form with an option selected would not send a useful value to the server; rather, each option needs to be given a "value" attribute
          * Without a "value", the text content of the option will be submitted to the server instead -->

        <label for="referrer">How did you hear about us?
          <select id="referrer" name="referrer">
            <option value="">(select one)</option>
            <option value="1">freeCodeCamp News</option>
            <option value="2">freeCodeCamp YouTube Channel</option>
            <option value="3">freeCodeCamp Forum</option>
            <option value="4">Other</option>
          </select>
        </label>

        <!-- STEPS 38, 40 & 41 - TEXTAREAS: 
          * The <textarea> element acts like an <input> element of type "text", but comes with the added benefit of being able to receive multi-line text with an initial number of text rows and columns
          * Note that the textarea requires a closing tag

          * Initially, the <textarea> appears too small by default
          * To give it an initial size, you can add the "rows" and "cols" attributes 
        
          * The "placeholder" attribute accepts a text value, which is displayed within the <textarea> until the user starts typing -->

        <label for="bio">Provide a bio:
          <textarea id="bio" name="bio" rows="3" cols="30" placeholder="I like coding on the beach..."></textarea>
        </label>
      </fieldset>

      <label for="terms-and-conditions">
        <input class="inline" id="terms-and-conditions" type="checkbox" required name="terms-and-conditions" /> I accept the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/terms-of-service/">terms and conditions</a>
      </label>

      <!-- STEPS 20 & 21 - FORM SUBMISSION:
        * The first <input> element with a "type" of "submit" is automatically set to submit its nearest parent form element
        * To handle the form submission, we add an <input> element with the "type" attribute set to "submit" and the "value" attribute set to "Submit" after the last <fieldset> element 
        * Initially, while you should be able to submit the form, you might notice not much happens since we haven't added interactivity or validation -->

      <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
    </form>
  </body>
