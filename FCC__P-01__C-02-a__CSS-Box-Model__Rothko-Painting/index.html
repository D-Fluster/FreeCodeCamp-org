    // See: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-the-css-box-model-by-building-a-rothko-painting/

    // DESCRIPTION:
    Every HTML element is its own box â€“ with its own spacing and a border. This is called the Box Model.

    In this course, you'll use CSS and the Box Model to create your own Rothko-style rectangular art pieces.

  <!-- STEP 3 - THE BOX BODEL:
    * In the CSS box model, every HTML element is treated as a box with four areas
    * Imagine you receive a box from your favorite online retailer -- the content is the item in the box, or in our case, a header, paragraph, or image element
    * See "/diagram-1" or https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-box-model/diagram-1.png -->

  <!-- STEP 4 - PADDING: 
    * The content is surrounded by a space called padding, similar to how bubble wrap separates an item from the box around it
    * Think of the border like the cardboard box your item was shipped in
    * See "/diagram-2" or https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-box-model/diagram-2.png -->

  <!-- STEP 5 - MARGINS:
    * Margin is the area outside of the box, and can be used to control the space between other boxes or elements
    * Here the bottom element has a larger top margin, pushing it further down the page
    * See "/diagram-3" or https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-box-model/diagram-3.png -->

  <body>

    <!-- STEP 11 - THE "FRAME": 
      * Every painting needs a frame, so we wrap the ".canvas" element in another <div> and give it a "frame" class -->

    <div class="frame">
      <div class="canvas">

        <!-- STEP 16 - THE SHAPES: 
          * We add a first new <div> element inside the ".canvas" element and give it the "class" attribute with a value of "one"
          * This will be our first rectangle, which is later styled using CSS -->

        <div class="one"></div>
        <div class="two"></div>
        <div class="three"></div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
