    // DESCRIPTION:
    CSS tells the browser how to display your webpage. You can use CSS to set the color, font, size, and other aspects of HTML elements.

    In this course, you'll learn CSS by designing a menu page for a cafe webpage.
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Cafe Menu</title>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    
    <!-- STEP 17 - RESPONSIVE VIEWS:
      * For the styling of the page to look similar on mobile as it does on a desktop or laptop, you need to add a <meta> element with a special "content" attribute as shown -->
    
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

    <!-- STEPS 10 thru 16 - STYLING:
      * Up until now, you have been limited regarding the presentation and appearance of the content you create
      * To start taking control, you can add a <style> element within the <head> element
      * You can add style to an element by specifying it in the style element and setting a property for it like this:
        **  element {
              property: value;
              }
      * This is called using a "type selector" to style the HTML <element>

      * You can add the same group of styles to many elements by creating a list of selectors with each selector separated with commas like this:
        **  selector1, selector2 {
              property: value;
            }

      * While styling can be done by writing CSS inside the style tags, since there will be many more styles, it's best to put all the styles in a separate file and link to it
      * To link the "styles.css" file so the styles will be applied in the same way, nest a self-closing <link> element in the <head> element with a "rel" attribute value "stylesheet" and an "href" attribute value of "styles.css" -->

    <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet"/>
  </head>
  <body>

    <!-- STEP 20 - DIVS: 
      * The <div> element is used mainly for design layout purposes, unlike the other content elements you have used so far 
      ** SEE CSS -->
    
    <div class="menu">
      <main>
        <h1>CAMPER CAFE</h1>
        <p class="established">Est. 2020</p>
        
        <!-- STEPS 66 thru 70 - HRs:
          * You can use an <hr> element to display a divider between sections of different content
          * Note that <hr> elements are self-closing 
          ** SEE CSS -->

        <hr>
        <section>
          <h2>Coffee</h2>
          <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-cafe/coffee.jpg" alt="coffee icon"/>

          <!-- STEPS 29 thru 35 - ARTICLES:
            * <article> elements commonly contain multiple elements that have related information
            * Here, we'll use <article> elements to contain the flavor and price of each item on the menu
            * Each element within the article can be styled (e.g., aligned) separately by adding and styling independent classes (e.g., "flavor" and "price") -->

          <article class="item">

            <!-- STEPS 36 thru 44 - BLOCK VS. INLINE ELEMENTS:
              * By default, each <p> element within an <article> will be stacked on top of each other
              * This is because <p> elements are block-level elements, so they take up the entire width of their parent element
              * To get them on the same line, this default behavior can be overridden by applyin some styling to the <p> elements so they behave more like inline elements
              * To do that here, we'll a class attribute with the value "item" to each <article> element (i.e., the mutual parent) 
              ** SEE CSS 
              
              * By default, "inline-block" elements only take up the width of their content; to spread them out, you can add width properties to the class selectors 
              * However, styling the <p> elements as "inline-block" and placing them on separate lines in the code creates an extra space to the right of the first p element, causing the second one to shift to the next line
              * One way to fix this is to make each of the two <p> elements' widths a little less than 50%
              * While you could keep trying various percentages for the widths, instead move the two <p> elements onto the same line in the editor with no space between them 
              ** SEE CSS  -->
