<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>

    <!-- STEP 4 - ABOUT UTF-8:
      * "utf-8" is a universal character set ("charset") that includes almost every character from all human languages -->

    <meta charset="utf-8">

    <!-- STEP 5: META TAGS:
      * You can have multiple self-closing <meta> elements on a web page
      * Each <meta> element adds information about the page that cannot be expressed by other HTML elements
      * The <meta> element with a "name" attribute set to "viewport" and a "content" attribute set to "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" makes it so your page looks the same on devices of all sizes -->

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

    <!-- STEP 3 - TITLES: 
      * Remember that the title element gives search engines extra information about the page
      * It also displays the content of that title element in two more ways:
        ** in the title bar when the page is open, and
        ** in the browser tab for the page when you hover on it. Even if that tab is not active, once you hover on the tab, the title text is displayed -->

    <title>Colored Markers</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>CSS Color Markers</h1>
    <div class="container">

      <!-- STEP 16 - MULTIPLE CLASSES & PRECEDENCE:
        * To give the markers different colors, you will need to add a unique class to each one
        * Multiple classes can be added to an element by listing them in the "class" attribute and separating them with a space
        * For example, the following adds both the animal and dog classes to a div element:
          ** <div class="animal dog">
        * If you add multiple classes to an HTML element, the styles of the first classes you list may be overridden by later classes -->

      <div class="marker red">
        <div class="cap"></div>
        <div class="sleeve"></div>

      <div class="marker green">
        <div class="cap"></div>
        <div class="sleeve"></div>
      </div>
      <div class="marker blue">
        <div class="cap"></div>
        <div class="sleeve"></div>
